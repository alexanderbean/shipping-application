Spring 2023 - Low-Code Shipment Tracking Application

This was a semester-long project in a technical project management course. My group and I were assigned to create and demonstrate a low-code application to solve a specific business issue. The sample company needed a system to track shipments and their contents, as well as monitor truck weight and truck driver hours.

My personal contributions to the project are Stages III-VI, covering the development of the Visio diagrams and models, the use case scenarios, the SQL database, and the Bubble.io frontend.
